The synchronization module is responsible for keeping all elevators updated on all elevators. It will continously broadcast messages to other elevators with
updated information on it self and new orders that needs distributing. In addition it continously update the elevators orderHandlers in so all new information on elevators states, direction, floor and current orders can be taken into account when calculating recipients of new orders. 
In order for an order to be accepted the receiving elevator will wait until it receives messages from all other online elevators where the order has been acknowledged.
