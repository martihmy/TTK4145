For this project we chose a fleeding master concept with a peer-to-peer UDP boradcast network solution. Every local order will be assigned to the best suited elevator by the elevator that received the order, making it the master for that order.
This requires that all elevators know about all others elevators state, direction, floor and queues, which is all broadcasted through synchronization module continously. 
Most of the specifications of this project were met, however we did not manage to implement functionality for order recovery in the case of motor stop or system crash. The elevator will receive and fulfill the order once the system/motor power is restored, but no other elevator will take this order in the meantime.
